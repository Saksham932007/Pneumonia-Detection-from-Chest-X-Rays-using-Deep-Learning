## 🩺 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using Deep Learning


### 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to automatically detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. Trained on the [Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset, this model can differentiate between **Normal** and **Pneumonia**-affected lungs with high accuracy.

It also includes an interactive **Google Colab app**, where users can upload a chest X-ray image and get an instant prediction.

---

### 🚀 Key Features

* ✅ Trained on 5000+ chest X-ray images
* ✅ Binary classification: **Normal vs Pneumonia**
* ✅ Streamlit and Google Colab compatible
* ✅ Real-time prediction with image visualization
* ✅ Ready-to-use `.h5` model

---

### 📊 Model Performance

| Metric                   | Value  |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| **Test Accuracy**        | 91.67% |
| **Precision (Normal)**   | 96%    |
| **Recall (Pneumonia)**   | 98%    |
| **F1-Score (Pneumonia)** | 0.94   |

> ✅ Evaluated on an unseen test set of 624 X-ray images.

---

### 🧠 Model Architecture

* Input size: `120x120x3`
* 3 Convolutional blocks (Conv + MaxPool)
* Dense layers with dropout
* Output: Binary sigmoid classification

You can further improve performance using **EfficientNetB0** or **ResNet50** with transfer learning.
